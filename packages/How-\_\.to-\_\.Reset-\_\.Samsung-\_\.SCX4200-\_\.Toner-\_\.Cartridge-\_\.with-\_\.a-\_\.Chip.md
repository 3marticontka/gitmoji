Why do you need to reset Samsung SCX-4200 toner cartridge chip?
 
The Samsung SCX-4200 is a multifunction printer that can print, copy, and scan documents. It uses a toner cartridge that contains black toner powder and a chip that communicates with the printer. The chip monitors the toner level and sends a signal to the printer when it is low or empty. When this happens, the printer stops printing and displays a message on the screen, such as "Toner Empty" or "Replace Toner".
 
However, sometimes the chip may not work properly and send a false signal to the printer. This can happen when you refill the toner cartridge with new toner, as the chip does not recognize the new toner level. It can also happen when the chip is damaged by dust, moisture, or other factors. In these cases, you need to reset the chip to make it work again and resume printing.

In this article, we will review the Best Audiophile Voices collection and highlight some of the best songs and singers in each volume. We will also explain why these albums are considered audiophile-grade and how they can enhance your listening experience.
 
## What is the Best Audiophile Voices Collection?
 
The Best Audiophile Voices collection is a project by Premium Records, a German label that specializes in producing high-fidelity recordings for audiophiles. The label has collaborated with various other labels and studios to select and remaster some of the best jazz vocal tracks from different artists and albums.
 
The collection features 15 volumes, each containing 15 tracks, that cover a wide range of jazz vocal styles, from standards to originals, from swing to bossa nova, from ballads to blues. The singers include well-known names like Eva Cassidy, Jane Monheit, Alison Krauss, Stacey Kent, Karrin Allyson, Nnenna Freelon, and more. The collection also introduces some lesser-known but equally talented singers like Jheena Lodwick, Kelly Flint, Tish Hinojosa, Cheryl Wheeler, Monica Mancini, and more.
 
The collection aims to provide a rich and varied listening experience for jazz vocal lovers and audiophiles alike. The tracks are carefully chosen to showcase the singers' vocal skills, emotional expression, musical interpretation, and artistic personality. The tracks are also recorded and mastered with high-quality equipment and techniques to ensure a clear, natural, and dynamic sound quality that can reveal every nuance and detail of the singers' voices.
 
## Why are these albums audiophile-grade?
 
Audiophiles are music lovers who seek the highest possible sound quality and fidelity in their recordings and playback systems. They often use specialized equipment and formats that can reproduce the original sound source as accurately and faithfully as possible.
 
The Best Audiophile Voices collection is designed to meet the standards and expectations of audiophiles. The tracks are encoded in FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), a format that compresses audio data without losing any information or quality. FLAC files can preserve the full dynamic range, frequency spectrum, and bit depth of the original recordings, unlike MP3 or other lossy formats that discard some data to reduce file size.
 
The tracks are also recorded and mastered with 24-bit resolution, which means they can capture more information and detail than the standard 16-bit resolution used in CDs or other digital formats. 24-bit resolution can provide a higher signal-to-noise ratio, lower distortion, and greater dynamic range than 16-bit resolution.
 
The tracks are also remastered with premium equipment and software to enhance their sound quality and remove any noise or imperfections. The remastering process also balances the levels, equalization, compression, and stereo imaging of the tracks to create a consistent and optimal listening experience across different volumes and singers.
 
## What are some of the best songs and singers in each volume?
 
While every volume of the Best Audiophile Voices collection has something to offer for jazz vocal fans, here are some of our personal favorites from each volume:
 
- Volume 1: Over the Rainbow by Jane Monheit. A stunning rendition of the classic song from The Wizard of Oz by one of the most gifted young jazz singers of her generation. Monheit's voice is pure, smooth, and expressive as she sings with effortless grace and elegance over a lush orchestral arrangement.
- Volume 2: Fields of Gold by Eva Cassidy. A haunting cover of the Sting song by the late Eva Cassidy, who died of cancer at age 33. Cassidy's voice is soulful, warm, and intimate as she sings with sincerity and emotion over a simple acoustic guitar accom 0f148eb4a0
